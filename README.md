# What is codingnightffm?

We'll have a proper kick-off to discuss ideas for coding nights.  
For now the **what** remains to be defined. 

# Hangout - Bring your own project
We're gonna have a first casual hangout on **Thursday, March 7**. (Location will be announced.)  
You're currently working on a project and don't want to code home alone?  
Welcome to our first #codingnightffm hangout! :)  

There's gonna be free wifi and drinks. And fellow coders to hang and chat with.
