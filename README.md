# What is codingnight&shy;ffm?

We'll have a proper kick-off to discuss ideas for coding nights.  
For now the **what** remains to be defined. 

# Hangout - Bring your own project
We're gonna have a first casual hangout on **Thursday, March 7**.  
We'll meet at the offices of [codemonauts](https://codemonauts.com/), Güntherburgallee 19.  
Doors open from 6.30pm, lights out around 10.30pm. You can join later, leave earlier… That's up to you.

You're currently working on a project and don't want to code home alone?  
Welcome to our first #codingnightffm hangout! :)  

There's gonna be free wifi, drinks and we may even put our trusty sandwich maker to work. Fellow coders to hang and chat with inclusive. ;)
